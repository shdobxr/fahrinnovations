My good friend, Master P. Happy Birthday! You have been there in times of need, or just times to talk, or just in the nick of time. 

Whether it be assisting with conversation, or providing an extra hand in whatever hairbrained project I am attempting - you truly have been an awesome friend.

It dawned on me one day how lucky I am to have such a friend who has the knowledge and the stick-to-itiveness (Yeah that is how you type that... thanks google) to attack those projects when others either lose interest or plainly feel like the project has lost it's capability to be accomplished. You hang in there.

This is something folks say they do, or try their best to explain. All you need to recall is the memory of "Hey lets install a remote start on a stick car!" and the long nights keep roaring back. The headaches, the smell of solder fumes. It was crazy, wasn't perfect. But hey we got it working alright. 


So, since you have always been super willing to help me. This provides a space to where I can assist you if you want, pertaining to the use of the domain or whatever it may be. Share awesome project stuff? Sure. Blog about tuning brake bias? Yep. Crafting, sharing build information about automotive or carpentry things? Sure can do. 

I want to be there for you in assisting with your goals, just like you've been there to assist me with mine. 

Cheers buddy, happy birthday to you!!!!!!

DG
